Team names: Weilan Liang, Dereje Teshager, and Aden Abdulahi

The team started working first iteration deliveries from January 27, 2025, to February 9, 2025.
We had conducted three meetings, and we created sprint/Iteration 0, and sprint/Iteration 1. In sprint 0 we spent a total
time of 18.5 hours while in sprint 1 we spent on a total of 26.5 hours.

The challenge: 1. On sprint 0 we had confusion on how to use YouTrack like creating account,
    creating cards, adding time, editing(changing/updating) time.
    2. UML creating, while we do not exactly know the classes, properties, and methods required for the project.
Solution: 1. After discussing as a team, watching lecture and youtube videos,
    reading we come up and solved the above challenges. Then in Iteration 1, it was easy to use YouTrack.
    2. We discussed and reached consensus on imagination, and agreed to modify according to the progress.
